import *imports

def atk(): # this bit is needed as it is what function the program calls in to run it
    print("attacking...")
    
if args are needed there are two ways to do this

way one:

from mod.system.*file*.*program* import *function to run*

def atk():
    *arg = input("enter agr: ")
    
    *if needed here* = *function*(*arg*)
    *if needed
    if *if needed here* == False:
      break
    else:
      pass
      
 way two:
 
 def atk():
   *arg* = input("enter arg: ")
   *function run*(arg)
   
 way two is if you want to call it localy and not from another module (can be slower)
